# KNN-Classifier

The supervised ML classification algorithm-KNN(K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm  is one of the simplest and widely used classification algorithms in which a new data point is classified based on similarity in the specific group of neighboring data points. This gives a competitive result. 

For a given data point in the set, the algorithms find the distances between this and all other K numbers of datapoint in the dataset close to the initial point and votes for that category that has the most frequency. Usually, Euclidean distance is taking as a measure of distance. Thus the end resultant model is just the labeled data placed in a space.

## Pima County Category Classification & Price Forecasting

The provided Pima County housing dataset contains 49 features 
● Four were used in the classification model:
      ○ Sales Price           ○ Longitude
      ○ Square Footage        ○ Latitude
● An additional nine features were chosen for potential use in the regression model:
      ○ Sale Date             ○ Number of Bathrooms
      ○ ZIP Code              ○ Number of Garages
      ○ Lot Size              ○ Garage Capacity
      ○ Year Built            ○ Pool Size
      ○ Number of Rooms

## Pima County exploration to analyze the houses that do not have their kitchens equipped.

In this project a database for Raw-Houses is presented. The objective is to do a deep exploration to analyze the houses that do not have their kitchens equipped using KNN (k nearest neighbors) and Linear Regression. Initially, we have a database with 5,000 observations and 16 features.

The document is divided into the follow ingsections for data processing, as shown below:
