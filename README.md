# KNN-Classifier

The supervised ML classification algorithm-KNN(K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm  is one of the simplest and widely used classification algorithms in which a new data point is classified based on similarity in the specific group of neighboring data points. This gives a competitive result. 

For a given data point in the set, the algorithms find the distances between this and all other K numbers of datapoint in the dataset close to the initial point and votes for that category that has the most frequency. Usually, Euclidean distance is taking as a measure of distance. Thus the end resultant model is just the labeled data placed in a space.

### Data Generation
Generatation of 200 random values, distributed around 20. Plotting the histogram will generate a not linear distribution...

#### Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.
