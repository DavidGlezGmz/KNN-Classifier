# KNN-Classifier

supervised ML classification algorithm-KNN(K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm. It is one of the simplest and widely used classification algorithms in which a new data point is classified based on similarity in the specific group of neighboring data points. This gives a competitive result. 

Working
For a given data point in the set, the algorithms find the distances between this and all other K numbers of datapoint in the dataset close to the initial point and votes for that category that has the most frequency. Usually, Euclidean distance is taking as a measure of distance. Thus the end resultant model is just the labeled data placed in a space.
